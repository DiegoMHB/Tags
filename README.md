# ThisNow!

## Project Description

ThisNow! is a web platform where you can explore posts from users all around the map! See custom markers for each post, click to get details, and interact with other users.

Create your own posts, check out what others are sharing, and chat in real-time. Everything you upload is safely stored in PostgreSQL, with images and files in Firebase.

Explore, share, and connect â€” all in one interactive map experience!
